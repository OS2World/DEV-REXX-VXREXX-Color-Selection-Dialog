  This is a simple color selection dialog that you can use in the programs you
write using VX-Rexx.  To install it, just ad the following line into your
projects .VRP file:     "VRX: ColorDlg.VRX" (Without the quotes)
  There are no parameters to use when calling this dialog.  When it returns the
colros, it returns them in the variable form "forecolor backcolor".  A simple
way to run this dialog is:  color = ColorDlg()
After exiting, the color variable should be in the form stated above.  If the
cancel button was clicked, then the variable would be "".
